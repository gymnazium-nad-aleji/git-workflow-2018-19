Pu'er or pu-erh[1] is a variety of fermented tea produced in the Yunnan province of China. Fermentation in the context of tea production involves microbial fermentation and oxidation of the tea leaves, after they have been dried and rolled.[2] This process is a Chinese specialty and produces tea known as 黑茶 hēichá (literally, 'black tea') commonly translated as 'dark tea'. This type of tea is different from what is known as black tea in English, which in Chinese is called 红茶 hóngchá (literally, 'red tea').

Pu'er traditionally begins as a raw product known as "rough" máochá (毛茶) and can be sold in this form or pressed into a number of shapes and sold as "raw" shēngchá (生茶). Both of these forms then undergo the complex process of gradual fermentation and maturation with time. The wòduī (渥堆) fermentation process developed in 1973 by the Kunming Tea Factory[3][4] created a new type of pu'er tea. This process involves an accelerated fermentation into "ripe" shóuchá (熟茶) which is then stored loose or pressed into various shapes. The fermentation process was adopted at the Menghai Tea Factory shortly after and technically developed there.[5] The legitimacy of shóuchá is disputed by some traditionalists in contrast to aged teas. All types of pu'er can be stored to mature before consumption, which is why it is commonly labeled with the year and region of production.
